    <h1>INXS - By My Side</h1>
    <h2>In the dark of the night <br>
        Those small hours <br>
        Uncertain and anxious <br>
        I need to call you </br>
        <p>Rooms full of strangers <br>
           Some call me friend <br>
           But I wish you were so close to me </p>
        In the dark of night <br>
        Those small hours <br>
        I drift away <br>
        When I'm with you <br>
  <p>       In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        I wish you were <br>
        I wish you were <br></p>
    
       Here comes the clown <br>
        His face is a wall <br>
        No window<br>
        No air at all <br>
       <p> In the dark of night <br>
        Those faces they haunt me <br>
        But I wish you were <br>
        So close to me <br></p>
        In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        I wish you were <br>
        I wish you were <br>
       <p> In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        In the dark of night <br>
        By my side <br>
        I wish you were <br>
        I wish you were <br></p>
        
       In the dark of night <br>
        Those faces they haunt me <br>
        I wish you were so close to me <br>
        Yes I wish you were <br>
        By my side..<h2></div>
